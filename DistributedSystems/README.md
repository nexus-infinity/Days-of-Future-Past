# Distributed Systems

**Server Orchestration and Scalability Infrastructure**

This directory contains configuration and code for distributed compute systems supporting *Days of Future Past*.

## 🌐 Overview

The **HOME FIELD pattern** enables scalable, distributed gameplay by orchestrating multiple server nodes that work together as a unified system.

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Coming soon:** Detailed documentation on:

- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment
- Load balancing strategies
- Data synchronization
- Monitoring and observability

## 📂 Planned Structure

```
/DistributedSystems/
  /docker/                  — Docker configurations
  /kubernetes/              — K8s manifests
  /monitoring/              — Prometheus, Grafana
  /scripts/                 — Deployment automation
  HOME_FIELD_pattern.md     — Architecture documentation
```

## 🎯 Goals

- **Scalability:** Support thousands of concurrent players
- **Resilience:** Fault-tolerant, self-healing
- **Efficiency:** Optimal resource utilization
- **Geographic Distribution:** Low-latency global access
