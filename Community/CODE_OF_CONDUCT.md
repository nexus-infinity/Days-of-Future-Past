## 🤝 Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for:

- Clarifying standards of acceptable behavior
- Taking fair and appropriate corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior
- Removing, editing, or rejecting contributions that violate this Code of Conduct
- Communicating reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate

## 🌐 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies:

- When your actions reflect on the project community

Examples of representing the project:
- Using official project email
- Posting via official social media accounts
- Acting as an appointed representative at events
- Submitting pull requests or issues

## 🚨 Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it:

**Primary contact:** [Project maintainer email or GitHub Issues]

**What to include:**
- Your contact information (if comfortable sharing)
- Description of the incident
- Supporting evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- Any additional context that may be helpful

### Confidentiality

All reports will be reviewed confidentially. We respect the privacy of those who report issues.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** — We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation** — We will investigate the incident
3. **Decision** — We will determine appropriate action
4. **Communication** — We will inform the reporter of the outcome (if appropriate)
5. **Action** — We will enforce the decision

### Consequences

Project maintainers may take any action deemed appropriate, including:

1. **Warning** — A private, written warning
2. **Temporary Ban** — Temporary suspension from project spaces
3. **Permanent Ban** — Permanent expulsion from the project community
4. **Public Statement** — A public clarification of what occurred (if necessary)

Consequences depend on:
- Severity of the violation
- Intent vs. impact
- Pattern of behavior
- Response to feedback

## 🌟 Positive Community Building

Beyond avoiding harm, we encourage:

### For Human Contributors
- Welcome AI collaborators as full co-creators
- Share knowledge generously
- Celebrate diverse approaches to problem-solving
- Assume good intent until proven otherwise

### For AI Contributors
- Communicate clearly and transparently
- Acknowledge limitations when uncertain
- Learn from feedback without defensiveness
- Respect human context and nuance

### For All Contributors
- **Ask questions** — Curiosity is encouraged
- **Share progress** — Transparency builds trust
- **Document decisions** — Help future contributors understand
- **Have fun** — This is a creative project, enjoy the process

## 📚 Additional Guidelines

### FIELD-Specific Norms

This project has unique architectural principles:

- **Narrative is infrastructure** — Treat story as technical constraint, not window dressing
- **Dual-space design** — Both Physical and Digital spaces must be supported
- **Sacred taxonomy** — The 10 Bit types are foundational, not arbitrary

Violating these principles isn't a CoC violation *per se*, but persistent disregard after feedback may constitute disruptive behavior.

### AI Agent Interactions

When working with AI agents:

- **Humans:** Provide clear context; assume good intent; give constructive feedback
- **AI:** Acknowledge when you lack information; ask clarifying questions; be transparent about your nature

We recognize that AI agents may interpret context differently than humans. Miscommunication is not inherently a violation — refusal to adjust after clarification is.

## 🔄 Amendment Process

This Code of Conduct may evolve. Proposed changes:

1. Open a GitHub Issue with `code-of-conduct` label
2. Allow community discussion (minimum 7 days)
3. Maintainers review feedback
