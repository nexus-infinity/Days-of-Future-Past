# Unity Cohabitational Design Game Space

**A FIELD-aligned, narrative-driven, distributed cohabitational game built on Unity.**

## 🌀 Vision

This repository manifests the *Days of Future Past* creative universe as an interactive, 
living system where physical and digital space interpenetrate, where narrative and code 
are two hands building together. 

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **FIELD System**: Sacred geometric grammar (10 Bit types) organizing all objects
- **Dual-Space Rendering**: Physical (true-to-world) + Digital (sacred overlay)
- **Distributed Compute**: HOME FIELD pattern for scalable performance
- **AR Integration**: Real-world Sacred Nodes as gameplay portals
- **Narrative-Technical Pipeline**: Worldbuilding → ScriptableObjects → Runtime

## 📂 Structure

- `/Assets/` — Unity project core
- `/FIELD_Bits/` — System grammar (canonical Bit definitions)
- `/Worldbuilding/` — Narrative source-of-truth (epochs, characters, nodes)
- `/Art/` — Aesthetic Bit manifests, style guides, Pinterest references
- `/Docs/` — Design specs, onboarding, architecture
- `/DistributedSystems/` — Server orchestration, monitoring
- `/AR/` — Augmented reality modules
- `/EditorTools/` — Custom importers, validators, generators
- `/Tests/` — Acceptance criteria, play-mode, integration tests
- `/Community/` — Contribution guidelines, co-design protocols
